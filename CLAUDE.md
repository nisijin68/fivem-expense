# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a fresh environment with no existing codebase. The directory `/home/kohei` is currently empty of project files.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty directory, you'll need to:

1. Initialize a new project based on the user's requirements
2. Set up the appropriate build tools and dependencies
3. Establish project structure and conventions

## Commands

No existing build, test, or lint commands are present. These will need to be established based on the project type and requirements.

## Architecture

No existing code architecture to document. This will be established as the project develops.

## Notes

- This is a fresh workspace without any existing project files
- Project structure, dependencies, and tooling will need to be established based on user requirements
- Future updates to this file should include specific commands and architecture details as they are implemented
